        "In production-grade RAG systems — as outlined in the foundational [RAG paper (Lewis et al., 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401) — documents are typically uploaded in batches, tokenized, embedded (i.e., converted into vector representations), and stored in a vector database such as Pinecone or Google’s Vertex AI Vector Search. These vectors are then queried at runtime using top-k similarity search (e.g., cosine, inner product, or Euclidean distance) to retrieve relevant context, which is combined with the user’s prompt to supplement downstream generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the original RAG framework, the retrieval component used token or segment based retrieval, while the generation component was based on pretrained models like BERT and BART.\n",
