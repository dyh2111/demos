# 🧪 Demo & Project Directory

Welcome to a personal collection of exploratory projects, practical exercises, and experimental builds. These aren’t necessarily polished or portfolio-ready showcases — they’re mostly functional walkthroughs, technical prototypes, and concept tests that support my learning and research across the ML landscape.

Some projects might be one-off notebooks, others half-built ideas or pipelines in progress. Think of this as a technical lab journal — **not** a product portfolio.

## 📂 Projects

These are functional or semi-complete builds focused on specific ideas or implementations.

- **🧠 [RAG-Practical](./RAG-Practical/)**  
  Hands-on walkthrough of a simplified Retrieval-Augmented Generation system — combining document retrieval and structured prompting to generate grounded responses from a small LLM.  This is a learning prototype, not a full document → embedding → vector DB pipeline.

<!-- Example: -->
<!-- - **🔍 [Named Entity Tagger](./NER-Tutorial/)** — A small-scale implementation of token-level classification using BiLSTM + CRF. -->

## 🚧 Work In Progress

These are early-stage builds, drafts, or experiments I’m still working through.

- **[MoE Router Comparison](./MoE-Router-Comparison/)**  
  Benchmarking various Mixture of Experts routing mechanisms (linear, MLP, Hadamard, hash-based) for token latency, load balancing, and entropy.

- **[LLM Patch Inference](./LLM-Patch-Inference/)**  
  Patch-based classification using ViTs and a global routing FFN to infer image-level labels from local predictions.
